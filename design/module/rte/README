INSTALLATION

  SyndRTE is tested on IE6 and Firefox 0.9.3 on Windows XP.
  
  A PHP and a javascript loader (loader.php/loader.js) are available, 
  they will detect the browser version and load the corresponding API.
  The PHP loader is preferable because it's much higher loading 
  speed. To include the editor into a page:
  
    <script defer="defer" type="text/javascript" src="/path/to/syndrte/loader.php"></script>

    or

    <script id="srte_loader" type="text/javascript" src="/path/to/syndrte/loader.js"></script>
    
  Notice the difference on 'defer="defer"' and id="srte_loader", the 
  javascript loader needs the id to work out the installation path and
  can't be deferred as it uses document.write().

  The javascript and PHP loader are desribed further in the
  separate files loader.js and loader.php.
  
  Use one or several div/textarea's with a classname of 'srte_area' 
  to enable the control, the id attribute determines the name of the 
  variable to be sent on submit.
    
    <div class="srte_area" id="data[INFO_BODY]" upload="/syndrte/upload.php">
    	Some <em>styled</em> text.
    </div> 
    
    or
    
    <textarea class="srte_area" name="data[INFO_BODY]"
		upload="/syndrte/upload.php">Some &lt;em&gt;styled&lt;/em&gt; text.</textarea>
  
  The file upload.php contains a fully functional example  of and 
  documentation on the image upload API.

  The Gecko API uses the eDOM extensions from Playsophy and parts of 
  the Mozile editor which are licenced under MPL 1.1/GPL 2.0/LGPL 2.1
