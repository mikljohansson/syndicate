INSTALLATION

 - Microsoft Installer (MSI) package
  
  Edit the Agent/Inventory.xml configuration file to suit your needs.
  At the very least; the address of the inventory server needs to be 
  provided. 
  
  Open Inventory.sln in Visual Studio 2005, select the Release build 
  target and choose to build the Installer project. The MSI package 
  (Installer/Release/Inventory.msi) can be installed directly or 
  through some package distribution system such as SMS, CCM or an 
  Active Directory domain.

 - Manual installation
  
  Build the Agent project using the Release target. Copy the binary 
  (Agent/bin/Release/Inventory.exe) and the example config file 
  (Inventory.xml) to a suitable directory. Edit the config to suit 
  your needs. 
  
  The Inventory.exe commandline parameters are:
  
    /install   - Installs the service (without starting it)
    /uninstall - Removes the service 
    /start     - Starts the service (can be combined with /install)
    /stop      - Stop the service

  Run "Inventory.exe /install /start" to install and start the agent.
  Log and error messages are sent to the application log (Control 
  Panes -> Administrative Tools -> Event Viewer)
  
CONFIGURATION
  
  ImageIdentifier defines the indentifier used for this operating
  system image (unique per machine), the purpose being to avoid 
  multiple OS copies when the os version/release is changed. Defaults
  to the os release (ie. Microsoft Windows XP Professional)
  
  Defining the RemoteService element enables the RPC server on the
  client, allowing central control of the installed agents. The 
  port (defaults to TCP port 7500) should be firewalled for ips
  other than the central server. Leaving out the RemoteService 
  element will disable the remote control listener.
  
  The AntiVirus element defines the location in the registry where
  the antivirus definitions version can be read. The LoadedImage 
  element defines where the loaded operating system image version 
  can be read. Neither element is required.
