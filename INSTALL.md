# Installation

Edit 'synd.inc' to suit your needs, for example by adding
classpaths and design dirs to be searched for class definitions 
and templates. 

To enable mod_rewrite from the webroot without having to install 
synd into the root directory; place .htaccess in the webroot and 
provide the path to the synd installation, for example:

    ErrorDocument   400     /synd/error.php
    RewriteRule     ^(.*)$  /synd/index.php?syndq=$1    [L,QSA]

Edit synd.inc and set $synd_config['write']['base'] to '/',
this will make generated urls point to the webroot.

Change the permissions on the synd/var/ directory to make is 
writable by the web server.
    
    chown apache synd/var
  
The first time some modules are loaded the extensions they depend 
on will be automatically compiled; this might take a few minutes 
during which the page load seem to hang. Run 'ps -Af' or 'top' on 
the server and you will see that configure/libtool/make is running.

For Internet Explorer compatibility with generated Excel documents it
it recommended to set Cache-Control in php.ini as
  
    session.cache_limiter = private, must-revalidate
  
Synd uses some packages from the PEAR (http//pear.php.net) 
repository, they can be installed with the command:

    pear install <package>
  
## PEAR Packages:

 * DB is required to use the synd_database_pear driver
 * Benchmark is required to run the profiler.
 * PHPUnit for running the automated tests.
 * PhpDocumentor for generating the documentation.
 * SOAP for using the soap module.

## PHP extensions

* The xmlrpc module uses the XML-RPC-EPI extension that is 
  bundled with php, use '--with-xmlrpc' to enable in build.
    
* You will need to install a PHP accelerator, we recommend
  APC (http://pecl.php.net/package/apc/) which is both excellent and
  freely available. It is not uncommon for it to speed up 
  page-loading by a factor of 5+.
  
* Synd has support for APC and memcached cache api's and will use 
  any available. For single server setups APC works best, when using
  multiple frontend servers a apc+memcached setup will cache script 
  bytecode locally while keeping all other caches distributed.

   * APC (http://pecl.php.net/package/apc/)
   * pecl/memcache (http://pecl.php.net/package/memcache/)
   * memcached (http://www.danga.com/memcached/)
    
* The html type and SyndHTML classes uses libtidy if available. The
  Tidy PECL extension can be installed with "pear install tidy" if
  you have libtidy installed. The bundled htmlfilter library will 
  always be used. 
  
  * Tidy (http://tidy.sourceforge.net/)
  * htmlfilter (http://linux.duke.edu/projects/mini/htmlfilter/)
  
* The mp3 type uses LAME for generating lo-fi files suitable
  for streaming using for example mod_radio.
  
  * LAME (http://lame.sourceforge.net/)
  
* The type_movie class uses MEncoder and transcode for generating 
  thumbnails. Be sure to get the mencoder win32 codecs.
  
  * MEncoder (http://www.mplayerhq.hu/)
  * Codecs (ftp://mplayerhq.hu/MPlayer/releases/codecs/)
  * transcode (http://zebra.fh-weingarten.de/~transcode/) 

* SyncML module make use of the pecl/wbxml extension and libwbxml
  
  * pecl/wbxml (http://pecl.php.net/package/wbxml/)
  * libwbxml (http://libwbxml.aymerick.com/)

* The index stemmer plugin uses the pecl/stem extension
  pecl/stem (http://pecl.php.net/package/stem/)
  
*  Xapian is released under the GPL, it requires the Xapian php 
  bindings to be compiled, it will be loaded on demand via dl(). 
  The module uses SWIG bindings to interface with the main libraries.

  * Xapian (http://www.xapian.org/)
  * SWIG (http://www.swig.org/)

* pdftk is used by SyndPrint to merge PDF templates with FDF data
  to print and download autogenerated PDF's.
  pdftk (http://www.accesspdf.com/pdftk/)
  
* The SyncML module is tested against Synthesis AG SyncML client for
  PDA's and smart phones
 
  * Synthesis (http://www.synthesis.ch/)
